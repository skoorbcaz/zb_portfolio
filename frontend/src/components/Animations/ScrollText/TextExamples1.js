            Studying texts and stiff meditation can make you lose your Original Mind. A solitary tune by a fisherman,
            though, can be an invaluable treasure. Dusk rain on the river, the moon peeking in and out of the clouds;
            Elegant beyond words, he chants his songs night after night.
          </p>
          <p>
            This treasure was discovered in a bamboo thicket — I washed the bowl in a spring and then mended it. After
            morning meditation, I take my gruel in it; At night, it serves me soup or rice. Cracked, worn,
            weather-beaten, and misshapen But still of noble stock!

            I watch people in the world
            <br />
            Throw away their lives lusting after things,
            <br />
            Never able to satisfy their desires,
            <br />
            Falling into deeper despair
            <br />
            And torturing themselves.
            <br />
            Even if they get what they want
            <br />
            How long will they be able to enjoy it?
            <br />
            For one heavenly pleasure
            <br />
            They suffer ten torments of hell,
            <br />
            Binding themselves more firmly to the grindstone.
            <br />
            Such people are like monkeys
            <br />
            Frantically grasping for the moon in the water
            <br />
            And then falling into a whirlpool.
            <br />
            How endlessly those caught up in the floating world suffer.
            <br />
            Despite myself, I fret over them all night
            <br />
            And cannot staunch my flow of tears.

            The world before my eyes is wan and wasted, just like me. The earth is decrepit, the sky stormy, all the
            grass withered. No spring breeze even at this late date, Just winter clouds swallowing up my tiny reed hut.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wind has settled, the blossoms have fallen; Birds sing, the mountains grow dark — This is the wondrous

          </p>
          <p>
            In a dilapidated three-room hut I've grown old and tired; This winter cold is the Worst I've ever suffered
            through. I sip thin gruel, waiting for the Freezing night to pass. Can I last until spring finally arrives?
            Unable to beg for rice, How will I survive the chill? Even meditation helps no longer; Nothing left to do
            but compose poems In memory of deceased friends.

            First blooming in the Western Paradise, The lotus has delighted us for ages. Its white petals are covered
            with dew, its jade green leaves spread out over the pond, And its pure fragrance perfumes the wind. Cool and
            majestic, it raises from the murky water. The sun sets behind the mountains But I remain in the darkness,
            too captivated to leave.

            My house is buried in the deepest recess of the forest Every year, ivy vines grow longer than the year
            before. Undisturbed by the affairs of the world I live at ease, Woodmen’s singing rarely reaching me through
            the trees. While the sun stays in the sky, I mend my torn clothes And facing the moon, I read holy texts
            aloud to myself. Let me drop a word of advice for believers of my faith. To enjoy life's immensity, you do
            not need many things.

            An old grave hidden away at the foot of a deserted hill, Overrun with rank weeds growing unchecked year

            his pupil, a youth with shaggy hair, Learning deeply from him by the Narrow River.

            In my youth I put aside my studies And I aspired to be a saint. Living austerely as a mendicant monk, I
            wandered here and there for many springs. Finally I returned home to settle under a craggy peak. I live
            peacefully in a grass hut, Listening to the birds for music. Clouds are my best neighbors. Below a pure
            spring where I refresh body and mind; Above, towering pines and oaks that provide shade and brushwood. Free,
            so free, day after day -- I never want to leave!

            Your finger points to the moon, but the finger is blind until the moon appears. What connection has moon and
            finger? Are they separate objects or bound? This is a question for beginners wrapped in seas of ignorance.
            Yet one who looks beyond metaphor knows there is no finger; there is no moon.

            The city lights flicker and gleam, But true peace is found in stillness. A leaf falling, a drop of dew,
            Remind us to let go and find beauty in the moment. The rat race of desire, A never-ending cycle of pain, Why

            our wants and needs, And find solace in simplicity.

            It is not easy to let go of our attachment to material possessions and desires. It takes discipline, focus
            and a certain level of detachment from the world around us. But by taking the time to slow down and

            path to true fulfillment.
